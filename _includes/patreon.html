<p>Our Patrons are a top priority, and to show our love we release bonus episodes called After Credits anytime there’s an additional film based on a book we discuss. We’ve covered the 1974 adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express as well as the 1997 TV Mini-series of The Shining. Patrons at any tier receive these bonus episodes, as well as articles and videos we find relating to adaptations, a monthly episode schedule, and first priority on episode recommendations.</p>
