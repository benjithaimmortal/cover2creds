<p>Cover to Credits is a Pittsburgh based podcast interested in how written stories are translated to film and TV and whatâ€™s gained or lost in the process. We discuss adaptations from all genres and time periods, analyzing what changes between mediums and creators. We also view adaptations from a feminist perspective, looking at how gender, race and sexual orientation is handled.</p>
