# For Ian George: may we continue to make beautiful things.

**Important Note**
- GitHub Pages is currently serving this on a side url `/cover2creds`
- `{{ site.baseurl }}` is set to all internal urls so I don't have to type that a billion times.
- This means that you'll need to use `bundle exec jekyll s --baseurl ''` when you're doing that localhost servy thing to set the baseurl to an empty string (instead of the baseurl that is set in `config.yml`).
